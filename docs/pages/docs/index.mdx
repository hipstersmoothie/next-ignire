`ignite` is a command line application (CLI) for creating super flexible documentation website in MDX and [react](https://reactjs.org/).
It takes care of the boring parts of setting up a documentation website so you can get straight to writing amazing docs!

`ignite` is a thin wrapper around Next.js and `next-mdx-enhanced`.

## Features

🏗 Add multiple top level docs sections just by adding more folders and mdx in `pages/`

🎯 Add a blog just by adding a `blog/` folder and some mdx files in `pages/`

💅🏼 Overwrite any HTML element and render the site how you want to

📖 Home Page (Break out into JS easy as hell)

🧸 Simple search (only work after a full production build)

👮🏼‍♀️ Route based layouts

## Example

Working with `ignite` is super simple!
All you need to do is start adding `.mdx` files to your docs folder!

**`docs/pages/docs/new-page.mdx`:**

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
---

With some killer content! :tada:
```

If you don't have a defined `_sidebar.mdx` this will automatically show up on your website!
You'll most likely create a `_sidebar.mdx` if you want to define the order of your docs in the sidebar.

**`docs/pages/docs/_sidebar.mdx`:**

```mdx
- [Introduction](./)
- [My Page](./my-page)
```
