`ignite` is a command line application (CLI) for creating super flexible documentation website in MDX and [react](https://reactjs.org/).
It takes care of the boring parts of setting up a documentation website so you can get straight to writing amazing docs!

`ignite` is a thin wrapper around Next.js and `next-mdx-enhanced`.
