For the most part you should not have to create a project specific configuration for you docs.
If you do, the following documents all of the available options.

## Configuration File

`ignite` uses [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig) to load its configuration file.
We support all formats that the default `cosmiconfig` configuration supports.

The two most commons ways to configure `ignite` is either through a json `.igniterc` at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "name": "My Project"
}
```

or if you're project is in JavaScript, directly in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "npm-package",
  "ignite": {
    "name": "My Project"
  }
}
```

## Options

### Repo

The repo that contains your project.
This can be a short slug if on public GitHub.

```json
{
  "repo": "hipstersmoothie/my-repo"
}
```

### Name

The name of your project.
This value is used in multiple places in the docs.

```json
{
  "name": "My Project"
}
```

### URL

The url you will be deploying to.

```json
{
  "basePath": "https://my.com/pages/your-project"
}
```

### Order

Control the order of the top level section in the navbar.
Each item in the array should be a name of one of your top-level documentation folders.
Any unordered sections will be put after your provided order in alphabetical order.

```jsonc
{
  // The Default
  "order": ["docs", "blog"]
}
```

### HTML Urls

Add `.html` to the end of each internal URL.

```jsonc
{
  "htmlUrls": true
}
```

### PurgeCSS

By default `next-ignite` will purge CSS it doesn't use.

You can turn off this behavior:

```jsonc
{
  "purge": false
}
```

## Remark and ReHype Plugins.

You can provide plugins for the underlying markdown and html libraries we use to add more features.

> NOTE: You can only specify these plugins in a JavaScript based configuration

```js
const toc = require("rehype-toc");
const withIgnite = require("next-ignite/next")({
  // your ignite options
  rehypePlugins: [toc],
});

module.exports = withIgnite();
```
