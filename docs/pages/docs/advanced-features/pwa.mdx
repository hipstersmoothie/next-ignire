To make your `next-ignite` website into a PWA do simply create a `docs/public/manifest.json`.

You do not need `icons` or `start_url`, `next-ignite` handles that for you.

```json
{
  "name": "next-ignite Docs",
  "short_name": "ignite",
  "description": "Fun docs site.",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "background_color": "#fff",
  "dark_background_color": "#11151d",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}
```
