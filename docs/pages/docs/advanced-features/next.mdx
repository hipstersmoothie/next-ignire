title: "Using Ignite as a Next.js plugin"
---

Most of `ignite`s features can be used as a plain Next.js plugin! :tada:

What you loose:

- can no longer use the `ignite` CLI
- can no longer use `.igniterc` file

And not much else (we said it was a thin wrapper right :wink:)

**`next.config.js`:**

```js
const withIgnite = require("next-ignite/next");

module.exports = withIgnite();
```

## Options

You can config `ignite` directly from your `next.config.js`.
This is the same configuration present in your `.igniterc`.
When using `ignite` as a Next.js plugin you config will not be loaded.

To see the available configuration options visit the [configuration documentation](../configuration).

```js
const withIgnite = require("next-ignite/next");

module.exports = withIgnite({
  basePath: "pages",
});
```
