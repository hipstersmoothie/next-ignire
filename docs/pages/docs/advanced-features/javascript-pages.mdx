title: "Writing Pages in JavaScript"

Since `ignite` is just a small wrapper around Next.js you can easily break out into JavaScript or TypeScript.
Simply change the file extension to the desired file type, rewrite the markdown to JSX, and you're done!

> This is especially useful for the home page where you will probably want to
> flex your design skills and really market your project.

There are however a few considerations to make when you are doing this.

## Layouts

`ignite` comes with a few [different layouts](./layouts) that render your mdx files.
When you break out into JS `ignite` can no longer automatically assign a layout to your page.
Luckily you can easily use any of these layouts in your JS pages too!

```js
import { makeNavBarLayout } from "ignite";

const NavBarLayout = makeNavBarLayout(
  // Provide any front-matter options to the layout here
  options
);

export default () => <NavBarLayout>My Page</NavBarLayout>;
```

## Styling

To style your JS page to look just like the rest of your app you will need to use the components provided by the `MDXProvider`.

Add the following usage of `useMDXComponents` to your code.
This hooks provides all the customizable components that `ignite` uses.
That includes everything from the base HTML components to the components that make up the sidebar and the navbar.

```tsx
import { useMDXComponents } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { makeNavBarLayout, Components } from "ignite";

const NavBarLayout = makeNavBarLayout();

export default () => {
  const components = useMDXComponents() as Components;

  return (
    <NavBarLayout>
      <components.h1>My Page</components.h1>
    </NavBarLayout>
  );
};
```

## Links

Any link that you

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { makeNavBarLayout, Components, formatPath } from "ignite";

const NavBarLayout = makeNavBarLayout();

export default () => {
  const components = useMDXComponents() as Components;

  return (
    <NavBarLayout>
      <components.h1>My Page</components.h1>

      {/* If serving from a basePath make sure to use formatPath! */}
      <Link passHref href={formatPath(`/${section}`)}>
        <components.a>Go somewhere</components.a>
      </Link>
    </NavBarLayout>
  );
};
```
