title: "Creating a Blog"
---

Adding a blog with `ignite` is super easy.
All you have to do is start adding `.mdx` files to a folder names `pages/blog` and set up the blog index page.

## Blog Index Page

Create a file in your `pages/` folder named `blog.js`.
This simplest way to get a blog index running is by using the sample component `ignite` provides

```js
import { BlogIndex } from "ignite";

const Blog = () => <BlogIndex />;

export default Blog;
```

If you want more control of what this page looks like you can use the lower level functions `ignite` provides.

In this file add the following to render a simple list of your blog posts:

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";
// getBlogPosts will return the blogs in reverse creation order
import { getBlogPosts, makeNavBarLayout } from "ignite";
import { useMDXComponents } from "@mdx-js/react";

// Make a layout with the navbar at the
const NavBarLayout = makeNavBarLayout();
// Get all the blog posts
const posts = getBlogPosts();

const Blog = () => {
  // Make sure to use the components defined for you docs!
  const components = useMDXComponents();

  return (
    <NavBarLayout>
      <components.h1>Blog</components.h1>

      <components.ul>
        {posts.map((page) => (
          <li key={page.__resourcePath}>
            <Link passHref href={page.__resourcePath}>
              <components.a>{page.title}</components.a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </components.ul>
    </NavBarLayout>
  );
};

export default Blog;
```

Once this is setup you're ready to start writing blog posts! :tada:

## Blog Post Format

A blog post is just another `.mdx` file, but it has a few more front-matter features.

You should always include a title.

```yaml
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
---

```

### author

You can include an author in the blog post, otherwise this information will get pull from the commit.
Include an email to display an avatar using gravatar.

```yaml
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
author: "Andrew Lisowski"
email: "lisowski54@gmail.com"
---

```

### date

Specify the date the post was created.
If not supplied this information is pulled from the commit date.

```yaml
---
date: "Thu, 12 Mar 2020 23:00:02 -0700"
---

```

### color

A color to use as the backdrop for a post

```yaml
---
color: "red"
---

```

### image

Instead of a color you can display an image as the backdrop.

```yaml
---
image: "http://image.com/example.png"
---

```
