title: 'Adding a Home Page'
---

A home/cover page is useful to give a quick overview of the thing you're documenting.
This is a great way to market your project.
Detailed techical documentation is great, but it's helpful to also include a higher level intro that sells new users.

With `ignite` all you have to do to acheive this is create and `index.mdx` in your page folder.
If mdx isn't enought to write this page just make it a JavaScript or TypeScript file.
You'll be able to fully control what your home page looks like! :partying_face:
