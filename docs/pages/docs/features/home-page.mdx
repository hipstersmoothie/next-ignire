title: "Adding a Home Page"
description: "Every website needs a fancy marketing page."

A home/cover page is useful to give a quick overview of the thing you're documenting.
This is a great way to market your project.
Detailed technical documentation is great, but it's helpful to also include a higher level intro that sells new users.

With `ignite` all you have to do to achieve this is create and `index.mdx` in your page folder.
If mdx isn't enough to write this page just make it a JavaScript or TypeScript file.
You'll be able to fully control what your home page looks like! :partying_face:

## MDX Features

If you write your home page using mdx there are a few options you can use to customize the `home-page` layout.

### Title

The layout for the home page template will display the title of your project by default.
To override this specify a different title in the front-matter.

```yaml
---
title: "Some other title"
---

```

### Tagline

To display a tagline below the name of you project use the `tagline` property in the front-matter.

```yaml
---
tagline: "The most flexible documenting website you've ever used"
---

```

### Color

Change the color of the main here and the `Getting Started` button

```yaml
---
color: "red"
---

```
