title: 'Customizing the Sidebar'
---

While it's cool you don't *have to* configure a Sidebar, you'll probably quickly find that you want some order.
Luckily `ignite` makes this super easy.
All you have to do is create a file `_sidebar.md` inside `pages/docs` and start organizing you docs.

This can be as simple as a list of links:

```md
<!-- The following could link to "."", "./" or "./index" -->
- [Introduction](.)
- [Getting Started](./getting-started)
```

## Titles

You can add a title between groups of links

```md
Welcome

- [Introduction](.) 
- [Getting Started](./getting-started)

Features

- [Custom Sidebar](./features/custom-sidebar)
```

## Dividers

Seperate sections of the sidebar even further.

```md
Welcome

- [Introduction](.)
- [Getting Started](./getting-started)

--- 

Features

- [Custom Sidebar](./features/custom-sidebar)
```
