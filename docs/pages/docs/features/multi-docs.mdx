title: "Multiple Top-Level Sections"
description: "HOw to have multiple top-level sections in your docs site"

Many times when you're writing docs you may need different sections with a completely different sidebar.
To accomplish this in `ignite` simply add more folders to your `pages/` folder.
Each folder will be turned into a new top-level section in the navbar.
The folder name is converted into a name for the navigation item.

For example, to add a new top level section called "Plugin Authoring" you would create the following folder structure.

```bash
ðŸ“¦docs
 â”£ ðŸ“‚pages
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚docs
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ index.mdx
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚plugin-authoring
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ index.mdx
 â”ƒ â”£ 404.js
 â”ƒ â”£ _app.js
```

By default the sidebar is in alphabetical order.
To change this add a [custom sidebar](./custom-sidebar).
