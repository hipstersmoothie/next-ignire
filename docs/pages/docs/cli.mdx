title: Using the CLI
---

The fastest way to start using `ignite` is through the command line interface (CLI) it ships with.
The CLI basically just wraps Next.js's CLI and adds some defaults.

## Commands

### `dev`

Start the development server.

```sh
yarn dev
```

### `build`

Build the website into static HTML files.

```sh
yarn dev
```

### `deploy`

Deploy your static HTML files to GitHub pages.

```sh
yarn dev
```
