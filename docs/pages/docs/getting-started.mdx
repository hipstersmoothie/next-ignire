`ignite` is distrubuted on `npm`.

```bash
npm i --save-dev ignite
# or
yarn add -d ignite
```

## Setup

Getting setup with `ignite` require you to create a few files in additon to all of your actual documentation.

First create a folder named `docs` and structure it to resemble the following.

```
ðŸ“¦docs
 â”£ ðŸ“‚pages
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚docs
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ intro.mdx
 â”ƒ â”£ 404.js
 â”ƒ â”£ _app.js
```

You **must have**:

- `pages/_app.js`
- `pages/404.js`
- `pages/docs/intro.mdx`

### `_app.tsx`

You need to at least do the following:

1. Import `MDXProvider`, `igniteComponents`, and combine the at the root of the app
2. Import `ignite`'s css
3. Import a `prismjs` theme to style the code block

```jsx
import React from "react";
import App from "next/app";
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { igniteComponents } from "ignite";

// Import a prismjs theme to highlight the code blocks
// Make sure to import this first! The order matters
import "prismjs/themes/prism.css";
// Import the css to style the docs
import "ignite/dist/main.css";

import { Anchor } from "../components/anchor";
import { H1 } from "../components/h1";

class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props;

    return (
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  }
}

export default MyApp;
```

### `404.js`

This is where most of the magic happens :confetti_ball:.
`useFirstPageRedirect` will determine what page to display first when routed to `https://your-app.com/docs`.
The default will redirect this URL to `https://your-app.com/docs/intro`.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useFirstPageRedirect } from "ignite";

export default function Custom404(props) {
  const page = useFirstPageRedirect();

  if (page) {
    return null
  }

  return <div>Oops, looks like we can't find that page!</div>;
}
```

If you want some other page to be the first page shown simply pass the name of the `.mdx` file you want to shown

```js
const page = useFirstPageRedirect('welcome');
```

Now a user would get redirected to `https://your-app.com/docs/welcome`.

## Start writing docs :tada:

Now that you have all that set up you can start writing documentation!
All you need to do is start adding `.mdx` files to `pages/docs`.
A good one to start with is `pages/docs/intro.mdx` since this will be the first page shown to the user.

**`pages/docs/intro.mdx`:**

```mdx
---
title: "My Introduction"
---

The start of my amazing documentation.
```

Now start up the development server:

```sh
yarn ignite dev
```

Once it's done loading you should see that that your documentation has loaded and `ignite` automatically created a sidebar for you! :astonished:
