# next-mdx-enhanced Dynamic Documentation Example

- add a blog just by adding a `blog/` folder and some mdx files in `pages/`
- Add multiple top level docs sections just by adding more folders and mdx in `pages/`
- Home Page (Break out into JS easy as hell)
- Simple search (only work after a full production build)
- Dynamically match `layouts` + add fallbacks based on routes

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

// TODO docs for setting up blog
// TODO document home page template
// TODO for more top level sections
// TODO docuemetn javascript pages
// TODO order top level sections
