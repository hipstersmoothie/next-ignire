# next-mdx-enhanced Dynamic Documentation Example

- add a blog just by adding a `blog/` folder and some mdx files in `pages/`
- Add multiple top level docs sections just by adding more folders and mdx in `pages/`
- Home Page (Break out into JS easy as hell)
- Simple search (only work after a full production build)
- Dynamically match `layouts` + add fallbacks based on routes

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

// TODO collapsed top-level sections when > 3 on desktop
// TODO document JS pages
// TODO Pr to next-mdx-enhanced for multiple layout dirs
// TODO / to focus on search
