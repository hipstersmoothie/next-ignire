# next-ignite

- add a blog just by adding a `blog/` folder and some mdx files in `pages/`
- Add multiple top level docs sections just by adding more folders and mdx in `pages/`
- Home Page (Break out into JS easy as hell)
- Simple search (only work after a full production build)
- Dynamically match `layouts` + add fallbacks based on routes
- Customize the dark and light mode syntax highlighting. Use any VSCode or textmate theme.

## Getting Started
